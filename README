This project is the implementation of a conversation between CÃ©sar Alvarez Doval and myself, a program which finds a path between two (apparently) unrelated artists.

== How to use it?

Right now we have very few code but you could try:

 gem install bundler

and then:

 bundle install

and then a tiny script such as:

 require "rubygems"
 require "bundler/setup"

 require 'lib/settings'

 Settings.lastfm.artist.get_similar("kid606").each do |artist|

   if artist.is_a? Hash
     puts "#{artist["name"]}: #{artist["match"]}"
   end

 end
